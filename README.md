## 🐺 What is Kaiku?

**Kaiku** (Finnish for *Echo*) is a modern, high-performance voice chat and Server-Centric overlay built specifically for gamers and esports teams who demand low-latency, reliable communication without system bloat.

Echoing the quiet precision of the North, Kaiku ensures your pack stays connected no matter the conditions, pulling inspiration from the sleek aesthetics of CachyOS Nordic combined with a robust and scalable WebRTC and Tauri-powered architecture.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **Low Latency Audio**: Optimized routing for immediate delivery of your callouts.
- 🛡️ **Military-Grade Encryption**: End-to-end encrypted by default. Your team's tactics stay yours.
- 💻 **Minimal Resource Footprint**: Uses minimal CPU. Play your games without FPS drops or frame pacing issues.
- 🎨 **Nordic UI/UX**: Premium, glassmorphic design inspired by the Northern Lights (CachyOS Nordic colors).
- 🐧 **Linux-First**: Native support out of the box for Linux gamers. (Windows & macOS arriving soon)
