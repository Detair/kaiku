# L1b implementation notes (v1.0 login, server flows)

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-03-v1.0-login-server.md` (Tasks 15–29, Task 30 gates).
Branch `feat/v1.0-login-l1b`, stacked on LP (`feat/v1.0-login-lp`, draft PR #744) at `6fd3ab54`,
which is stacked on L1a (draft PR #743). Spec rev 5 and contracts C26–C29 win over the plan; every
deviation and judgment call is listed here, per task. "Coordinator" marks items that need a
decision. "For L2" marks interface facts the clients need.

## Task 15 — credential states, generations, blocklist, recovery codes

- `factors::mark_compromised_tx(conn, ctx, user_id, used, cause, actor)`: an extra `actor`
  (the plan has none), so the `*_compromised` event names who caused it.
- `recovery_codes::replace_tx(conn, ctx, user_id)` takes `ctx`: replacing the set starts a new
  generation and runs `cascade::on_generation_ended` (B.7 rule 2).
- `factors::clear_throttle_tx` returns whether the state changed and applies the whole B.1 exit
  table (`factors::exits`): `compromised` leaves only by replacement/removal, a completed request
  or the CLI; an admin clears `throttled` only.
- `StateCause::Cli` sends `cause: "cli"`, appended to C28's list.
- Legacy backup codes stop working now: `/auth/login` and `/auth/mfa/verify` no longer accept them
  (F8); `/auth/mfa/backup-codes[/count]` answer 404. The `mfa_backup_codes` table stays until the
  upgrade migration (Task 25) drops it. `reauth::verify_reauth` had only the backup-code route as
  caller and is deleted here (the plan deletes it in Task 16).
- Blocklist: SecLists renamed the planned file; the bundled list is
  `Passwords/Common-Credentials/xato-net-10-million-passwords-100000.txt` (MIT, commit
  `c205c36a`), stored as `server/data/password-blocklist-top100k.txt.gz` and embedded with
  `include_bytes!` (new direct dependency `flate2`, already in the tree). Context words: `kaiku`
  and the username, display name and server name, whole, without spaces and per word, ≥ 4
  characters, case-insensitive substring.
- `PASSWORD_REJECTED` is a 400 with `reason` (`length`, `breached`, `context`).
- Recovery codes: 13 characters from the RFC 4648 alphabet (5 bits of an OS-random byte each),
  shown `ABCDE-FGHIJ-KLM`; a malformed input costs one dummy Argon2 verify.
